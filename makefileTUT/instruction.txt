As you can see, we have hello.c, message.h, message.c shown in this directory.
To make compilation of hello.c, hello.c and message.c should be firstly compiled.
To do this, we may need the help from 'makefile':
    1. Create a "M/makefile" (case sensitive)
    2. Config the "makefile" with following format:
        target(hell) : dependencies(hello.c, message.c)
         (tab) actions
            ...
        e.g.
        helloMakefile : hello.c message.c
            gcc hello.c message.c -o helloMakefile

The makefile will automatically check whether the dependencies have any changes since last compilation, and re-run the correspoind actions when dependencies are changed.

Tips: using gedit or emacs for editing makefile. Using vim may encounter the 'mysterious tab' problem XD...
